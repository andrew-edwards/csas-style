% test.bib - some example multi-author refs. Mainly mine as I know some
%  good examples. Andy.

% abbrev4.bib  - for POP 2013 Res. Docs (areas 3CD and 5DE). Extending
%  my global bib file. Putting new references into correct format, ones that
%  have moved into global alphabetical order have been double checked. 30/5/13.

% This is my global .bib file that I've added to over the years (hence some of
%  the notes below are very old!). 

% To co-authors - please add any new references at the very bottom of this file,
%  I've included an example as a template. I'll then double check them and
%  move up into the alphabetical list. My format for referring to papers is
%  (and see below for an example):
%
%  single author - first four letters of surname plus two digits for year, 
%   e.g. smit99 for Smith 1999 (so in .tex file I say \citet{smit99}
%
%  2-6 authors - initials of surnames, then two digits for year
%
%  >6 authors - first four letters of first author, then two digits for year
%   (except for Viswanathan which  I did viswan96 and viswan99 for some reason).
%  
%  Towards the end there are entries done by my colleague Rowan which are in a 
%   different format - I haven't moved them up to my main entries if I haven't
%   double checked them with the originals.
%  I will tidy up and double-check any new entries you add as necessary, so that
%  I know this file remains accurate. Thanks!    

% Example of my formatting:

% **article{bbga05, 
%       initial of surname of each author followed by two 
%        digits for year. If 1 or >6 authors then just first 
%        four letters of first author's surname. (Usually).
%    author    = {S. Bertrand and J. M. Burgos and F. Gerlotto and J. Atiquipa},
%        Always spaces between initials and 'and' between authors
%   title     = {L\'evy trajectories of {P}eruvian purse-seiners as an indicator of the spatial distribution of anchovy ({{\it E}}{\it ngraulis ringens})},
%   fulljournal   = {ICES Journal of Marine Science},  
%      spell out full journal title here, then abbreviated in the next field - so
%      can easily switch them in a bib sty file if need the full journal spelled 
%      out
%   journal   = {ICES J.~Mar.~Sci.},
%   year      = {2005},
%   volume    = {62},
%   pages     = {477-482}
% }


% At the end (starting with Barrie) are further entries from other people - 
%  these aren't in my format and I haven't double checked them, but they 
%  may be useful.   10/4/15.

% Older notes:

%  
%  Now using
%    journal   = {DFO Can. Sci. Advis. Sec. Res. Doc.}, 
%  rather than usual
%    journal   = {DFO Can.~Sci.~Advis.~Sec.~Res.~Doc.},
%  because it splits the line at DFO and won't split elsewhere. Can't really
%  tell if double spaces after. (Maybe recent latex realises it's not 
%  separating sentences).
% Also add a period at the end of non-abbreviated journal names (unusual
%  ones like    
%  journal      = {Fisheries and Marine Service, Nanaimo, BC, Data Record.},
%    that aren't abbreviated.
% I have done CSAS SAR's and Res Doc's just as usual articles, rather than
%  create a new category. CSAS may insist that the : should be a . before the 
%  page numbers. Just do manually in .bbl file.
% Also, manually do the ordering correctly for multiple-author references. 
%
% Any websites have to be clickable in the .pdf. This gets done automatically
%  but wouldn't work if they had _ in them, which is \_ in latex. May need
%  href package for that. So not giving links for Res Docs. \& does work
%  automatically though, I think \_ gets coded differently.



%  Had also added Jaclyn Cleary's Articles-1.bib file, dated 8/8/2012, but
%  very long and not same format as mine, so removing.

% abbrev3.bib - my global bib file. Rowan's is PBSrefs.bib, and I'm adding
%  those at the end of this (probably sticking with his naming convention)
%  and also adding resDocSty/Articles-1.bib to the end, which is Jaclyn`s
%  from her herring 2012 assessment.  2nd October 2012.

% Think I alwasy did max of 6 authors, but for Viswan 96 and 99 just doing as
%  viswan96, viswan99, as will need a lot. 5th October 2006
% Adding in references for fronts paper. 24th January 2000 (and after).
% abbrev3.bib - updating abbrev2.bib (actually hasn`t changed), and renaming since old version will still be stored on lahave. 8th November 1999
% abbrev2.bib - adding in extra refs for edyo paper - 3rd March 1999 Putting James`s at end, not in my style (and may not be correct either, but keep for possible reference). Replacing 'number    =' with 'issnumber =' to avoid using the issue number, which no journals seem to use (except DSS). It seemed to do Yodzis Nature ref okay in thesis, with no number given. 'number' only appear in this context (i.e. not in any titles). 57 replacements.   137 refs in my style (3rd March 1999).
%
%
% abbrev.bib - abbreviating all journal titles from plankton2.bib. And updating some - see bibhelp. 7th Dec 1998
%
%
% This is the version as used for thesis. Future ones (paplin*.bib) will have updated refs (eg Yool), and then planktonbmb.bib will be for Bulletin of Mathematical Biology (abbreviated journal titles) 13th May 1998 at WHOI
% Some of these  reference names need correcting - the ones theived off James at the beginning are not in my format, and aren`t used in my thesis.
% Put spaces inbetween the initials...and need {**} for capitals (unless title of a book - for which we should have capitals (hence it doesn`t need {*})).
% will88 slightly fiddled as its an article in a special journal issue, which has editors and an extra title.
% For capital italics do {{\it C}}
% misc doesn`t give an address
% Do edition of a book in the title, eg {Elements of Marine Ecology -- Third Edition

%' <-- to counter-act the apostrophe's disruption of syntax highlighting (place after a ref, not within)
