Simplest for me to just reference mostly my own papers/assessments as I know of
some good examples of the issue.

\citet{eb96} and \citet{eb99} did some stuff. So did \citet{eb01}. 

This comes out fine, since same three authors (though not in same order) 
and the same year, so makes sense to order by the second author (since the same 
year).
\citet{ebp00} and \citet{epb00} -- different Edwards, so are listed at the very 
end (alphabetical by first initial).

There are more refs \citep{edwa01, edwa08, efbj12}.

This one gets put in the wrong place: \citet{ez90}.

Some assessments with similar authors are 
\citet{ehs12, ehs14area5DE, ehs14area3CD}; the latter are again the same three 
authors and same year.

More are \citet{ehs15, epw01, esh12, erpbb17}.

The one- and two-author papers look to obey the rules in Issue \#4, but 
multi-author ones do not obey:

iii) Papers with three or more authors appear after the dual-authored papers 
and are arranged chronologically. 

These currently get arranged alphabetically (by second, or higher if necessary, 
author, instead of by year).
