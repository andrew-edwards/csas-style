# csas-style
Latex style files for CSAS research documents

## Branches

**temp** - Andy updating .sty and including a .bst. Separate branch from master so as to not mess up the Herring assessment.

## Files

**res-doc.sty** - formatting style file 

**res-doc.bst** - bibliography style file

**resDoc-rh.bst** - this contains code by Rowan Haigh to underline hyperlinks in url or doi fields from your .bib file. Andy does not use these, and so can't really test them. If you want to use them then do a diff on this and **res-doc.bst** and then include the extra bits of code. Some stuff is commented out and I'm not sure if it has to be.
